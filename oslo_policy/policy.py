Common Policy Engine Implementation

Policies are expressed as a target and an associated rule::

    "<target>": <rule>

The `target` is specific to the service that is conducting policy
enforcement.  Typically, the target refers to an API call.

For the `<rule>` part, see `Policy Rule Expressions`.

Policy Rule Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Policy rules can be expressed in one of two forms: a string written in the new
policy language or a list of lists. The string format is preferred since it's
easier for most people to understand.

In the policy language, each check is specified as a simple "a:b" pair that is
matched to the correct class to perform that check:

 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
 |            TYPE                |                SYNTAX                    |
 +================================+==========================================+
 |User's Role                     |              role:admin                  |
 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
 |Rules already defined on policy |          rule:admin_required             |
 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
 |Against URLs¹                   |         http://my-url.org/check          |
 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
 |User attributes²                |    project_id:%(target.project.id)s      |
 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
 |Strings                         |        - <variable>:'xpto2035abc'        |
 |                                |        - 'myproject':<variable>          |
 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
 |                                |         - project_id:xpto2035abc         |
 |Literals                        |         - domain_id:20                   |
 |                                |         - True:%(user.enabled)s          |
 +--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

¹URL checking must return ``True`` to be valid

²User attributes (obtained through the token): user_id, domain_id or project_id

Conjunction operators ``and`` and ``or`` are available, allowing for more
expressiveness in crafting policies. For example::

    "role:admin or (project_id:%(project_id)s and role:projectadmin)"

The policy language also has the ``not`` operator, allowing a richer
policy rule::

    "project_id:%(project_id)s and not role:dunce"

Operator precedence is below:

 +------------+-------------+-------------+
 | PRECEDENCE |     TYPE    | EXPRESSION  |
 +============+=============+=============+
 |      4     |  Grouping   |    (...)    |
 +------------+-------------+-------------+
 |      3     | Logical NOT |   not ...   |
 +------------+-------------+-------------+
 |      2     | Logical AND | ... and ... |
 +------------+-------------+-------------+
 |      1     | Logical OR  | ... or ...  |
 +------------+-------------+-------------+

Operator with larger precedence number precedes others with smaller numbers.

In the list-of-lists representation, each check inside the innermost
list is combined as with an "and" conjunction -- for that check to pass,
all the specified checks must pass.  These innermost lists are then
combined as with an "or" conjunction. As an example, take the following
rule, expressed in the list-of-lists representation::

    [["role:admin"], ["project_id:%(project_id)s", "role:projectadmin"]]

Finally, two special policy checks should be mentioned; the policy
check "@" will always accept an access, and the policy check "!" will
always reject an access.  (Note that if a rule is either the empty
list (``[]``) or the empty string (``""``), this is equivalent to the "@"
policy check.)  Of these, the "!" policy check is probably the most useful,
as it allows particular rules to be explicitly disabled.

Generic Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `generic` check is used to perform matching against attributes that are sent
along with the API calls.  These attributes can be used by the policy engine
(on the right side of the expression), by using the following syntax::

    <some_attribute>:%(user.id)s

The value on the right-hand side is either a string or resolves to a
string using regular Python string substitution.  The available attributes
and values are dependent on the program that is using the common policy
engine.

All of these attributes (related to users, API calls, and context) can be
checked against each other or against constants.  It is important to note
that these attributes are specific to the service that is conducting
policy enforcement.

Generic checks can be used to perform policy checks on the following user
attributes obtained through a token:

    - user_id
    - domain_id or project_id (depending on the token scope)
    - list of roles held for the given token scope

.. note:: Some resources which are exposed by the API do not support policy
enforcement by user_id, and only support policy enforcement by project_id.
Some global resources do not support policy enforcement by combination of
user_id and project_id.

For example, a check on the user_id would be defined as::

    user_id:<some_value>

Together with the previously shown example, a complete generic check
would be::

    user_id:%(user.id)s

It is also possible to perform checks against other attributes that
represent the credentials.  This is done by adding additional values to
the ``creds`` dict that is passed to the
:meth:`~oslo_policy.policy.Enforcer.enforce` method.

Special Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special checks allow for more flexibility than is possible using generic
checks.  The built-in special check types are ``role``, ``rule``, and ``http``
checks.

Role Check
^^^^^^^^^^

A ``role`` check is used to check if a specific role is present in the supplied
credentials.  A role check is expressed as::

    "role:<role_name>"

Rule Check
^^^^^^^^^^

A :class:`rule check <oslo_policy.policy.RuleCheck>` is used to
reference another defined rule by its name.  This allows for common
checks to be defined once as a reusable rule, which is then referenced
within other rules.  It also allows one to define a set of checks as a
more descriptive name to aid in readability of policy.  A rule check is
expressed as::

    "rule:<rule_name>"

The following example shows a role check that is defined as a rule,
which is then used via a rule check::

    "admin_required": "role:admin"
    "<target>": "rule:admin_required"

HTTP Check
^^^^^^^^^^

An ``http`` check is used to make an HTTP request to a remote server to
determine the results of the check.  The target and credentials are passed to
the remote server for evaluation.  The action is authorized if the remote
server returns a response of ``True``. An http check is expressed as::

    "http:<target URI>"

It is expected that the target URI contains a string formatting keyword,
where the keyword is a key from the target dictionary.  An example of an
http check where the `name` key from the target is used to construct the
URL is would be defined as::

    "http://server.test/%(name)s"

Registering New Special Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is also possible for additional special check types to be registered
using the :func:`~oslo_policy.policy.register` function.

The following classes can be used as parents for custom special check types:

    * :class:`~oslo_policy.policy.AndCheck`
    * :class:`~oslo_policy.policy.NotCheck`
    * :class:`~oslo_policy.policy.OrCheck`
    * :class:`~oslo_policy.policy.RuleCheck`

Default Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A default rule can be defined, which will be enforced when a rule does
not exist for the target that is being checked.  By default, the rule
associated with the rule name of ``default`` will be used as the default
rule.  It is possible to use a different rule name as the default rule
by setting the ``policy_default_rule`` configuration setting to the
desired rule name.
